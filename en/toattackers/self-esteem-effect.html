            <h3>How does sexual violence affect self-esteem?</h3><br>
            <p>
                When a child grows up with respect and care, he or she finds himself or her valuable. They experience a safe foundation to take on new challenges. As you develop your ability and confidence, you feel secure about yourself and the way you are becoming yourself.<br><br>
                Sexual violence interferes with this process of positive self-esteem. When a child is sexually assaulted, he or she is violated by his or her vigilance, the right to say "no", and control over the world. They become lethargic. Even if you tell them what happened to you, they won't be told that you made it up or the other person won't even pretend to have heard it. Sometimes they get scolded. If the reality that happened to them is denied or distorted, they will be on the verge of madness. Rather than looking down on the perpetrator or parents, they may believe that they deserve violence because they think that they are bad and that they are not worthy of care. Lonely and isolated. <br><br>
                Many children who have been sexually assaulted are told that they will never succeed, that they are slow, or that they are only good at sex. It is extremely difficult to trust yourself while being forced into these messages.<br><br>
                <h4>Many survivors feel this way:</h4><br>
                - Mean, dirty and disgraceful.<br><br>
                - He's as helpless as a victim.<br><br>
                - He's different from everyone else.
                - There is something wrong deep inside. <br><br>
                - If people get to know them, they will leave.<br><br>
                <h4>Some survivors feel this way:</h4><br>
                - He hates himself.<br><br>
                - I don't want to move or I don't feel motivated.<br><br>
                - Experience sacrifices (violence, assault and beating) repeatedly as an adult.<br><br>
                - Self-destructive urges or suicidal urges.<br><br>
                <h4>Often survivors struggle in this regard.:</h4><br>
                - He doesn't know what his needs are.<br><br>
                - You can't take care of yourself or comfort yourself.<br><br>
                - I'm not in a good mood. - I'm in a bad mood.<br><br>
                - He doesn't trust his intuition.<br><br>
                - He doesn't know what his interests, talents and goals are.<br><br>
                - I'm afraid to succeed.<br><br>
                - I can't finish what I've decided to do.<br><br>
                - I don't think he can get into his life.<br><br>
                - I have a compulsion to be perfect.<br><br>
                - To compensate for feelings of inadequacy, they try to do excessive work or achievements.<br><br>
