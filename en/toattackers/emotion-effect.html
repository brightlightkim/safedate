            <h3>How does sexual violence affect emotions</h3><br>
            <p>
                Emotions are also respected when children grow up in a healthy environment. When they are sad, angry, or afraid, parents and caregivers can recognize and safely express their feelings. Children who grow up with emotional support are not punished for expressing any emotion without being told to suppress them. Therefore, they learn that emotions are not dangerous. The ability to control difficult emotions naturally grows as they grow.<br><br>
                Children affected by sexual violence rarely receive this kind of support. They don't even have enough time to express their fear, pain, shame or anger. Pain can go to extremes. If you notice how deep your sadness and despair is, even if you are nine years old, you will not be able to solve simple addition and subtraction.<br><br>
                Their pure love and trust have been betrayed, so it is natural that they cannot trust their feelings. Without the emotional control they express, they accept the message that emotions bring violence. Anger meant beating or furniture flying away.<br><br>
                Children affected by sexual violence learn how to hide their pain. It may be because the pain is so hopeless, or because the perpetrator should not be satisfied with watching them cry. Since it is impossible to select and block emotions, they choose to stop the flow of emotions at all.<br><br>
                On the other hand, it can be swayed by many emotions. It also feels like being pushed away by fear, sadness, shame and anger. They often live with that worry without any comfort and no way to express their feelings safely.<br><br>
                <h4>What survivors often struggle with:</h4><br>
                - It's hard to recognize your feelings.<br><br>
                - It's hard to notice the subtle differences between emotions.<br><br>
                - It's hard to express feelings.<br><br>
                - It's hard to stay calm when you're angry.<br><br>
                <h4>Many survivors have this feeling:</h4><br>
                - I'm lonely because I'm disconnected from other people.<br><br>
                - constantly feel shame.<br><br>
                - I feel only a few emotions that are limited rather than a variety of course.<br><br>
                - It's hard to handle emotions.<br><br>
                - I'm confused.<br><br>
                - I feel like I'm dead.<br><br>
                - It's easy to fall into despair.<br><br>
                - He suffers from anxiety and falls into airport conditions.<br><br>
                - Repeat the state of excessive anxiety, fear, anger, numbness and blocking of everything.<br><br>
                - The tension continues.<br><br>
                - I often have nightmares.<br><br>
                - I'm afraid of emotions.<br><br>
                - I'm afraid I'm going crazy.<br><br>
                - Little joy, relaxation, or pleasure.<br><br>
