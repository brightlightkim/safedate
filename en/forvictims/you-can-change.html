            <h3>You can change.</h3><br>
            <p>
                It can be suffocating to think about all the ways you have applied in dealing with it. Admitting this, however, is a positively changing first step. <br><br>
                As a child, there weren't many choices. You did what you had to do to survive. Now there are more resources. You can change self-destructive patterns and dispose of coping patterns that are no longer valid for you. You can train healthier responses to develop positively and create new habits that can trade off your previous counterparts. This process will not be easy. Of course there will be a retreat, but it is certainly possible to make meaningful and significant changes.<br><br>
                Each survivor will have a unique look on this journey. Everyone starts with their own opportunities and limitations. Coping with positive enlightenment - such as succeeding at work or opening up and enriching relationships - will have a much wider opportunity compared to relying on drugs not to face a painful past. It is also difficult to encounter many possibilities even if imprisoned in prison or mental hospital. Your health, socioeconomic status, race, and level of education affect your opportunity. But no matter what the situation is, you can make better choices and change your life. <br><br>
                However, in order for anyone to start anew, they must begin by recognizing their way of dealing and forgiving themselves. There is no such thing as a reason for you to live with shame. You've done the best you can as a child in a force majeure environment. You've earned the title of 'The One Who Disappeared from Sexual Violence Victims'. Now you are an adult with the power to change. Where there is self-acceptance and self-love, you can change positively.<br><br>
                <hr>
                <h3>Writing Training: Response</h3><br>
                You have read the various ways people cope so far. Some things will be there for you and others won't. Now it's time to write about your handling. Describe how you remember your way of dealing, how you have dealt with it so far, and how it affects your life now. Be as detailed as possible, but start with a respectful view of what you have done. <br><br>
