            <h3>Survival techniques for healing</h3>
            <p>
                Healing is a tricky task. It picks on the traditional way of dealing with pain, fear, and sadness that has been deeply hidden. Then they ask to change life from the roots. It is important to be kind to yourself when you suffer from the painful pain that follows as sexual violence is cured. However, the common side effect of sexual violence is that they are not only insensitive to their needs, but they also do not realize that they have to take care of themselves. So one of the first difficulties in the healing process is that it is necessary to develop new survival techniques. That is, how to take care of yourself. <br><br>
                Often survivors ask Laura how far they progressed in the healing process. Laura's answer is consistent. She asks them again. "What do you do to be considerate of yourself?" This is a much better indicator of your healing than the answers to how much treatment you have received, how much tears you have shed, and how much damage you have told people.<br><br>
                Ask yourself. Am I generous to myself for making mistakes? Do you rest and rest during the intensive healing process? Can I do what I enjoy doing? Are you sleeping enough and eating healthy food? Are you a member of a community of people who love and support each other? Can I admit that things are going well in my life? Are there any things I'm proud of in my work? If you answer most of the questions yes and you are making progress in that direction, you are on the right track of healing. However, if you are in the early stages of healing, you may not be able to answer a single question. Many survivors are so busy avoiding and coping and just keeping their lives that they cannot afford to pay attention to how well they take care of themselves. But even if you're just stepping back, you can move little by little towards taking care of yourself.<br><br>
                You can start with a gentle attitude toward the process of healing itself. Forcing does not promote healing, but rather hinders it. Therefore, learning how to relax, laugh, eat well, sleep well, and enjoy moments is just as important as learning to suffer from shame, grieve and express anger. You need a quiet time to gather and integrate your strength. Of course, peace of mind is one of the goals of the healing process and is valuable in itself.<br><br>
                If you're in the early stages of healing and your life is full of painful emotions, memories and crises, slowing down, stabilizing and taking time to heal can seem like a ridiculous vain kick. It's so terrible right now that I want the pain to go away. However, healing from sexual violence is not a tea ceremony. It's a gradual process and it starts at a small routine stage. You have to take a long time to settle down. You should learn to live your life while healing. <br><br>
                <h4>Overcome isolation</h4><br>
                Fortunately, if you have a supportive family or a member of such a community, you have a safety net that will be a source of great comfort and strength. But many survivors are in serious isolation. A woman named Krishnavai expressed her isolation so well.<br><br>
                There was a car accident. The drunk driver drove towards me. I went to the hospital and the doctor told me. "I think it's okay, but don't be alone in the meal. Do you have a roommate?" "No." "Do you have a friend to call?" "No." "Do you have a family to call?" "No."
                He looked at me with a very sorry expression and asked me again. 'You mean there's no one around you?' 'Yes.'
                Being alone for the rest of your life can make it difficult to create close relationships. However, finding safe people and learning trust is the key to the healing process. You've already dealt with sexual violence alone. Healing does not have to be isolated by itself.<br><br>
                <h4>Advanced support</h4><br>
                Support networks are the organizational system of people who help you live your life well, and they are also a tricky task of healing. They give you practical help. Serve meals, take care of your children, take you to the hospital, and help you find a new place to live. They also provide intelligent support. Present books and materials that will help you and talk about strategies and plans. It also gives emotional support. Sitting next to you when you cry and comforting you when you feel down. They support you mentally and inspire you and give you hope. <br><br>
                People in your support network firmly believe in your ability to heal yourself. Rather than seeing you as a damaged person, I perceive you as a good person who is going through difficult times. They recognize the potential and beauty in you that you can't see. Above all, they like and respect you. It encourages you to grow up, keeping track of what you think of yourself for a long time. When you're with them, you're encouraged, cared for, and your words are listened to carefully.<br><br>
                You are healing, so it is important to organize your life so that you can contact people who respect you, understand you, and take you seriously. This is what you couldn't do as a child and what you really need now.<br><br>
                Think of yourself as valuable to the extent that you are on a different level from the people you are involved in. Even if you are not in a position to completely sever relationships with people who do not respect you, clean up your relationships with people who are not kind or caring.<br><br>
                <h4>Evaluating Relationships</h4><br>
                Look at your relationship. Do you interact with Gu Gu every day, every week, every month? Think of roommates, relatives, friends, neighbors, coworkers, fellow students, acquaintances, people in the faith community, counselors, and other professors who help. Think about them one by one and see if you can ask them to do it, trust them, and share your feelings safely. Is there anyone who knows you're a victim of sexual violence and supports your healing? Are there people who haven't talked about your damage yet who seem to be very considerate? The depth and breadth of your understanding of close people play an important role in creating a network of support.<br>
                <br>If you're about to have a relationship, start with one person. Having one trustworthy person means your experience can be dramatically changed. <br>
                <br>
                Learn how to help </h4><br>
                The support network is only helpful when you use it. It may sound natural, but it is not easy to say. People who grew up in violent families often think that they should do everything on their own, either in great danger situations or with help. The reason why I'm afraid to ask for help is because I think it would be hard to rely on someone, be controlled, and admit or deny my "weakness." <br><br>
                If you're hesitant to reach out and ask for help, think about whether you'll step up and help when a friend in your position asks for help. Then both those who need help and those who want to help will find something valuable to each other. There are people in your life who want to help if they can. But if you don't tell them what you're going through and what you need, it's a situation that ruins the opportunity to go to them.<br><br>
                Once you acknowledge that you need help and deserve it, you must make a big decision and ask for it yourself. Sometimes you don't get what you want, but sometimes help comes from unexpected places in a totally unexpected way.<br><br>
                Pay attention to the reactions around you when you ask for help. Your demands may be respected and accepted or condemned. If you continue to receive negative responses, you may have misplaced the number and asked the wrong person (or someone who is too busy or has no interest in having this kind of relationship with you), or you may have asked the wrong way. Try it yourself and see what you can get and try again (even if it's not direct or clear, not specific, or asking too much at once).<br><br>
                <h4>주면서 보상받기</h4><br>
                지금이 당신의 욕구가 특히 강렬한 때라 하더라도 잊지 말라. 당신에게도 남에게 줄 수 잇는 귀중한 것들이 있다는 점을 때로는 불면 곧 쓰러질 것 같고 슬프고 낙담하고 절망적일 때 다른 누군가의 욕구에 집중하면서 큰 위안을 받을 수도 있다. 다른 사람에게 주목하면서 우리의 강점을 떠올리게 되고 자기존중감이 회복된다. 당신이 누군가를 도울 때 일시적이기는 하지만 당신의 고통에서 벗어나서 다른 누군가와 소중하게 연결되는 느낌을 받는다.<br><br>
                물론 다른 사람을 돕는다는 핑계로 당신 자신의 욕구에 집중하지 않으려고 한다면 그런 패턴은 얼른 끊어내는 것이 중요하다. 당신의 치유가 최우선이다.<br><br>
                <h4>Reward while giving</h4><br>
                Don't forget this is a particularly intense time for your needs. Sometimes you feel like you're about to collapse if you blow that you have valuable things that you can give others, and when you're sad, discouraged, and desperate, you can be greatly comforted by focusing on someone else's needs. Attention to others reminds us of our strengths and self-respect is restored. When you help someone, you feel like you're out of your misery, but you're connected dearly to someone else.<br><br>
                Of course, if you're trying not to focus on your own needs under the pretext of helping others, it's important to cut off that pattern quickly. Your healing comes first.<br><br>
                <h4>Preciousness of Counseling</h4><br>
                Among the many supporting networks of survivors, competent counselors are particularly important resources. A good counselor is a witness who watches with empathy for your healing and knows the area well and can lead you throughout the healing process. It can provide consistent support and encouragement, hope and information and insight, as well as be a safe relationship for you to grow.<br><br>
                Your counselor should be someone who cares about you sincerely and continuously reflects your essential values to you.<br><br>
                The counselor provides a place where you can pour out the secrets, pain, and hope that you have kept in your heart. Through such sharing changes take place.<br><br>
                In a relationship with a strong therapeutic personality, something special happens, such as magic. Various emotions are revived, the old chirping is restored, the vision of life is renewed, and the future is held with many possibilities. Treatment is a powerful tool for change.<br><br>
                <h4>Handle panic</h4><br>
                Fear is part of an extremely normal life and part of the healing process. The more you get used to fear, the less difficult it becomes. However, there are often times when fear is overwhelmed by the first step in the healing process.<br><br>
                Panic is fear that rises uncontrollably. You panic when you're afraid of your feelings and you don't have the skills to deal with them calmly, or when you have to struggle crazily to press emotions or memories. Sometimes panic comes when the past penetrates into the present and feels like the miserable situation is being reproduced.<br><br>
                Although panic seems to come from depression, there is always a trigger. It's something that reminds you of past violence but you don't know. Randy Taylor panic every time he stops in front of a red light. As I felt stuck, I remembered the situation where I felt trapped when I was victimized by sexual violence from my relative.<br><br>
                This connection is usually not recognized when panic strikes. You just don't seem to be in control. My heart beats faster and I'm out of breath. You might sweat and just want to run, and you might explode. Even the vision for the future can be different. I'm afraid I'm going crazy. If you don't understand what's going on, it's only going to get worse. <br><br>
                So if you feel overwhelmed or panic, breathe. Sit down like that. Often women think they need to do something else to get out of fear or warning. But the intention to escape in this way accelerates it more than quell fear. So don't try to act in a hurry. Instead, reaffirm to yourself that it is just an emotion, though extremely powerful, and that emotions always change.<br><br>
                If you are overwhelmed with extreme fear, you can escape it by expressing your feelings. Of course it's only possible when you're in a safe environment. The treatment group can be a good place to touch deeply hidden emotions. Driving home time is not a good situation. If it's not the right time to express your feelings or act accordingly, or if expression rather encourages panic, refer to the steps that keep you calm.<br><br>
                <h4>Calm down</h4><br>
                If you want to deal with panic most effectively, you can catch it early. Once the panic is uncontrolled and becomes large, it becomes difficult to deal with. But at least you can focus your self-centeredness in a positive way. That way, you won't hurt yourself or others. <br><br>
                The important thing to calm down is to do what works for you. Whatever it is, it is fine as long as it is safe to look stupid or embarrassed. Through trial and error, you can find and list things that help you. Try activities that use as many senses as possible (tactile, auditory, visual, taste, smell). It's important to reach out to others, even if it's something you hate to do the most.<br><br>
                When you're in a panic, you can't think creatively or clearly, so make a list at a quiet time. If you've written it down in advance, just pick up this list and do it in order.<br><br>
                What I have to do when I'm in despair.
                1. Breathe.<br><br>
                2. Look around. Find out where I am and what's actually happening now.<br><br>
                3. Turn on relaxation videos, videos, dramas and movies.
                4. Go and sit in the rocking chair.
                5. Make a list of the people in the support network and keep calling. (Write down your name and phone number)br><br>
                6. Touch the cat. (If you don't have a pet, a doll is fine.)br><br>
                7. Take a hot bath.
                8. Meditate.
                9. Clean the floor or wash the dishes, clean the bathtub or polish the stove simply with your body.<br><br>
                10. Run the neighborhood three times.<br><br>
                11. Listen to soothing music.<br><br>
                12. Pray.
                13. Write in your diary.
                14. Draw a picture, play with mud and make a collage.
                15. Breathe.
                16. Leave home and do something safe that I like.
                17. Scream into my pillow.
                18. Watch old movies, favorite dramas on TV, smartphones, laptops, or read mystery novels.
                19. Eat something healthy and light (Write the name of the food here and carry it with you).br><br>
                20. Start all over again.<br><br>
                <a href = suicide-though.html>If you're thinking of suicide...</a><br><br>
                <hr>
                <h4>Create a safe place</h4><br>
                It's a good idea to create a safe place to go at home or anywhere when you're in fear. A safe place can be a hallway window, a bed or a favorite chair. It could be a hiding place where no one can find you. It is said that a woman slept in a closet with her shoes on all night. It was also an attempt to comfort myself in a house where there was no safe place when I was young.<br><br>
                If you're not emotionally controlled and afraid of what you're going to do, go there and promise yourself that you'll take a slow deep breath until that feeling passes. As long as you're there, promise yourself you won't hurt yourself or anyone. You'll be safe.<br><br>
                If you run into a mountain of fear, anger, sadness, or despair, you may die right now, let alone subside in a few hours or you may ask for help. But Ellen asks the survivors to do this. "Don't sit in your chair and get up if you think you can't make it through the night even if you try everything you can. It will be the most miserable night of your life, but it will come in the morning and you will survive without hurting yourself. <br><br>
                <h4>Change Environment</h4><br>
                Consciously changing your environment also helps you escape from fear. It could be something as simple as getting out of the bedroom, going to the kitchen and making tea, or going out for a walk into the neighborhood. If you are out of town, you can get some inspiration by looking at the stars or trees.<br><br>
                Sometimes, through some senses, memories of being sexually assaulted in the past can come back and ruin your mood. The smell of a particular perfume, someone's tone, and the sound of a corduroy pants hitting each other can really cause anxiety. <br><br>
                <h4>Some things to avoid</h4><br>
                - Do not enter situations where you may be stressed or in danger.<br><br>
                - Stay off the road.
                - Do not drink alcohol or abuse drugs. <br><br>
                - Do not make important decisions unless necessary for your safety.<br><br>
                - Don't hurt yourself or anyone else.<br><br>
                - Avoid unsafe or unreliable people.
                <h4>After calming down</h4><br>
                Relax and get some rest when you're out of fear, self-loathing or despair. You need to recharge your energy because such intense emotions exhaust you. Try to figure out what caused it when you find calm again.<br><br>
                - What was the last thing you did before you were overwhelmed?<br><br>
                - Where have you been? Who were you with?<br><br>
                - Was there anything that confused you the day before or before? (Was there anything that upset you or your friends or lovers?) Did you get a heartbreaking call? Or did you receive such a letter?)<br><br>
                - What emotional agitation did you have before you lost your reason? Have you ever felt that before?<br><br>
                - Are you under special stress? Are you pressured by time or money? <br><br>
                - Are there any thoughts that you erased quickly because it makes you uncomfortable? Have you been familiar with these ideas for a long time?<br><br>
                - Do these things remind you of being sexually assaulted in any way?<br><br>
                This analysis helps you avoid falling into the same orbit next time.<br><br>
                <h4>Importance of Self-Care</h4><br>
                It is quite important to learn how to take care of yourself. It is not only in the situation of crisis, but also in everyday life. Like many survivors, you may believe that life should not be taken care of (or until it is in such a crisis) without being completely torn apart. But it is not. <br><br>
                If you train with intent, taking care of your emotional needs can become a daily habit as if brushing your teeth. Self-care is at the heart of healing. It's a way to send love and respect to you as a child and to you as an adult now and to you in the future. <br><br>
                What about medication?</h4><br>
                I have experienced that medication is helpful in balancing. There is a drug that helps the survivor. Like SSRIs, for example, anti-depression drugs are useful. Neurostabilizers and sleeping pills have also been helpful to survivors during a difficult process. Antipsychotics are also effective for survivors who show signs of hallucination and coldness. Thanks to these drugs, small doses sometimes allowed many survivors to continue to function properly and heal as they made great progress.<br><br>
                Some people have to take these drugs in the long run. Others can restore emotional equilibrium with short-term doses and maintain balance without medication.<br><br>
