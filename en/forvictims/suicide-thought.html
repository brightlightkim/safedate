            <h3>Do not commit suicide.</h3><br>
            <p>
                "When I had to say to myself, "You can't get over that tension, so you can't reach your target," I felt a real urge to commit suicide. I felt like something important, the last thing that gave me strength in my life, had collapsed. So there was nothing more to look forward to. It's only been a few months since I started planning again. It meant that I decided I wanted to live."<br><br>
                When you're really in a bad mood, you want to die. The pain is too great, too self-loathing and too deep in fear to really want to live. These are your real feelings, and they are irresistibly important. In addition, should not act in accordance with that feeling that important. It's okay to feel you're devastated, but don't hurt yourself.<br><br>
                We've already lost too many women. Too many adult and child victims committed suicide in despair without sufficient support. We can't lose any more. We can't lose you. You are well worth living.<br><br>
                You've been taught to face anger inward. What's so bad about wanting to die is that you have that kind of anger inside you. The anger should have been rescheduled for those who had hurt you so badly young. The closer you get to that anger, the more self-loathing will be diluted. You'll want to keep your life going. <br><br>
                All of this takes time. In the meantime, don't kill yourself and seek help. If the first help doesn't work, seek another. Don't give up. It's hard to imagine that you can have a different feeling when you feel bad enough to die. But you can do it. And I will. One survivor wrote in his diary:<br><br>
                "I don't want to live. I hate myself. I don't like what I did to myself. I want to crawl into the dark ground and hide myself. I hate that I have to remember. I hate that I have to erase the memory of sexual violence damage and dig it over and over again to find my life. Why do I have to live again? How do you know it won't be painful anymore? How can you keep wanting me to act for something so unfamiliar and out of hand?"<br><br>
                "But I'm still doing it. There's something in me that's incredibly powerful. Because it brought me to life despite all the times of disillusionment and despair and three suicide attempts. And it's still there to keep me alive, to act, to remember, to fight the best, to be angry, to cry and to feel. And share... Let's share...Let's share! It pushes me to move on to an unknown place called life."<br><br>
                Ask for help immediately if you want to kill yourself or start feeling self-inflicted. If you are suffering from suicide, it is important to get help from a competent therapist. You should also know the phone number of the suicide prevention hotline in advance. Store in a conspicuous and accessible place with the therapist's phone number. That way, you can find the number even in the most difficult situations. <br><br>
                One important thing you should remember is that this feeling will pass. You may think that those feelings will make you really unbearable when you run out. But you can learn to send them. It's like a hard birth. A woman giving birth to a child thinks she can't stand the pain next time, but she does. And the pain goes by.<br><br>
                Every time you can endure the pain of your feelings without hurting yourself, every time you can stay safe, ask for help, and get close to yourself, you build a spirit of fighters more and more. You will fight back against the memories brainwashed by the perpetrators and finally win the fight. I won't let them destroy you. <br><br>
                You deserve to be loved. He is a person who is so precious to someone and who becomes happy with his or her very existence. So please bear with me and wait for the sun to rise again in life.<br><br>
