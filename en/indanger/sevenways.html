            <h3>Like this when you're in real danger!</h3><br>
            <p>
                According to a study conducted by Ms. Miz, women who escaped rape had a relatively low level of emotional response to earlier attacks by their counterparts. In other words, he felt less fear, self-criticism, helplessness, and shock than the women who were affected. On the other hand, they were found to have responded more actively by running away from dangerous situations or shouting for help.<br><br>
                Which of the methods of responding to rape by acquaintances is not very effective? It's a way to persuade an opponent by crying or talking. This worked for some men, but arguments with perpetrators often led to rape. It also showed that the effectiveness of aggressive defense such as shouting or running away is considerably less.<br><br>
                Feeling threatened with rape varies from person to person, and depending on specific circumstances. Nevertheless, experts on sexual violence advise that what is presented below will help them escape the rape damage situation.<br><br>
                <h4>1. Keep your composure.</h4><br>
                You must use all your wisdom in a situation of damage, so you must never give in to fear. Therefore, it is necessary to be cool and determined.<br><br>
                <h4>2. Watch the situation and act quickly</h4><br>
                In order to know how dangerous your situation is, you must identify and judge the following points. If I run away, can I get to where other people are? Can other people listen or come to help you if you shout? How violent is the opponent who is threatening you? Is the opponent a physical force or weapon, or is it more likely to bother you verbally? And so on.
                Then if you decide how to respond, it's best to act without delay. The perpetrator will never just stand around waiting for you to do something.<br><br>
                <h4>3. Try to escape.</h4><br>
                Running away can be a way to catch the perpetrator off guard. So run towards a place where you can see lights, buildings, roads, etc., where people can be. Don't worry if you're ashamed to jump into crowded restaurants or movie theaters. You're the one who needs help, and you need it immediately. Eaksdir It's best to get out of the car if you're in the car, but if you can't, honking your horn can be one way.<br><br>
                <h4>4. Scream for help.</h4><br>
                It's best to run away but it can be difficult to do it out. When that happens, I say, "Help me." I'm being assaulted in the parking lot." "Do you have a cop? Help me," you'd better yell at people around you and let them know immediately that you're in trouble. Screaming "Fire" can also be effective. <br><br>
                Also, if the perpetrator is frightened by your cry and stops acting temporarily, he may have a chance to run away, so I recommend you run after shouting if possible.<br><br>
                <h4>5. Fight back with a strong attack if necessary.</h4><br>
                Most victims tend to hesitate to physically attack the other man when they know him, rather than when he is a stranger. But sometimes physical attacks are necessary, and if you decide to do so, you have to be as mean and bold as possible. Don't worry if your opponent gets hurt. Rather, think only about what you have to do in the future and prepare in advance for the fact that you cause him pain. And be aware exactly that all you have to keep in mind is to buy time to run away by incapacitating your opponent. But you should also know that your attack can make your opponent more violent. <br><br>
                In order to be able to act on attacks against opponents in a situation of damage, it is helpful to read books on self-defense or take related courses.<br><br>
                <h4>6. Buy time by talking.</h4><br>
                I could run away. If you can't fight, try to talk. Attempts to persuade the perpetrator to stop the attack are of little use. So just drag time through conversation. <br><br>
                For example, some victims encourage the perpetrator to find them attractive, while others use a method of asking the perpetrator. <br><br>
                Any kind of conversation, if you think the perpetrator no longer needs to use violence and relax, then you may have the best chance to run towards the door. (Or go to the bathroom and escape through the window, or lock the bathroom door and shout out the window to let others know.))<br><br>
                <h4>7. Break the seductive image.</h4><br>
                Tonya, who was raped by an unknown person at the age of 20, remembered the power the perpetrator exerted on her, the feeling of being controlled by her, and even the meanness he showed. So when he met another man at the age of 23 and went on his first date, he immediately noticed his intentions when the man, who had been pouring alcohol into a wine glass all night, finally tried to act against her will in a remote parking lot.<br><br>
                That's when Tonya started acting weird, saying she was in danger of being raped again. The trees around them were talking nonsense about coming to catch them, and they acted as if they had hallucinations. The other man eventually gave up his attempt to rape and drove Tonya home. Here's what she says about the situation at the time. "I don't know how sick he was of my behavior that night. He got me out of the car quickly."<br><br>
                There are other ways to prevent attacks. If you actually have a period, you can let them know, and you can lose interest by saying you have a STD or are pregnant. Or, peeing on the floor, picking one's nose, burping, farting and throwing up can be effective in breaking the typical framework that men often feel "tempty" about women. However, it should also be aware that any of these methods may not work before they are put into action.<br><br>
