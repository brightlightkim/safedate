            <h3>9 Handling Ways</h3><br>
            <p>
                When raped by a stranger, most women know that they have to ask for help immediately after the incident. On the other hand, when the perpetrator is an acquaintance, it is often not able to respond clearly due to grooming crimes. For such victims, sexual violence counselors and women who have experienced recovery after the damage give the following advice: <br><br>
                <h4>1. Believe in yourself.</h4><br>
                If you're forced to have sex against your will, it's obviously rape, whether it's your current date, your ex-boyfriend, or your old friend or just your acquaintance. The same is true even if the perpetrator did not use a weapon and you did not have physical trauma. <br><br>
                You may blame yourself for the rape damage. But it's not your fault. The incident was wrong only because the perpetrator was determined to do such a thing to you.<br><br>
                Looking back on the situation at the time, you can judge for yourself that you did something stupid (drunk, accepting a man's offer to give you a ride, or going to his apartment, motel, hotel, etc.). But no one can hold you responsible for being raped for doing such a thing. Because there is no one in the world who deserves to be raped, nor does there deserve to be raped. <br><br>
                Talk to someone. Talk to someone.
                Perhaps you want to bury the whole incident as deep as possible to forget what happened to you. But don't do that. Instead, contact the person you trust (close friends, sisters, parents, counselors, advisors, etc.) immediately, and go to his or her house. And tell them what happened. Also, contact the rape crisis center in the area for help before changing clothes or washing yourself. They will not only listen to your story, but also give you realistic ways to respond and help you in the tough process ahead.<br><br>
                <h4>3. Get medical help.</h4><br>
                If you've been raped, you're most likely hurt. It is also important to check for pregnancy and STDs and to collect evidence, so it is necessary to visit a hospital or a student health center in a university for medical examination immediately after the incident. At this time, you'd better accompany someone you can trust (a family member, a friend, or someone else you can help).<br><br>
                <h4>4 Decide whether to report to the police or university (or to the institution in which you and the perpetrator belong).</h4><br>
                Reporting the incident to the police or any institution can be a terrible ordeal in itself. In that case, you have to state in great detail what happened, and there is a high possibility that you will have a medical examination to collect evidence (sperm, saliva, blood, hair-kirak) left around the genital organs, anus, and mouth.<br><br>
                Police and prosecutors will question the rape case closely and may express their doubts publicly in your statement. In addition, he will repeat his testimony several times, including court testimony, to prosecute criminal charges against the perpetrator. Perhaps at this time the perpetrator would argue that you readily agreed to the sexual relationship with the perpetrator. The perpetrator may also ask you to negotiate a conviction to end up with a lighter charge. Despite all this cumbersome and difficult process, the trial results can turn out differently than you expected. The perpetrator could be sentenced to a light sentence or even acquitted. Of course, there is a possibility of conviction.br><br>
                There are so many difficulties in reporting cases and there is a good chance that negative situations will arise, but why should rape cases be reported by acquaintances? One thing is clear: you are the only one who can decide whether to report or not. But you can refer to other people's opinions that encourage reporting.<br><br>
                The biggest reason why many people recommend reporting is that only then can he prevent another crime by putting the perpetrator in front of the law to judge and punish him. Another target of the crime here may be someone else, but there is a possibility that it will be you, so quickly arresting the perpetrator is also the way to protect yourself.<br><br>
                Some women who reported the incident also say this. Through the process of experiencing a series of situations that took place, he was able to recover his power to live again. In particular, the women who watched the perpetrator get arrested and convicted confess that they were finally able to escape from the sense of damage and other aftereffects by obtaining such results.<br><br>
                In the current situation where precedents of rape by acquaintances are still being made, there are also opinions that the more cases reported and prosecuted, the more helpful it will be for a woman who will suffer from similar incidents, so it is hoped that the decision will be taken into consideration. And some states offer economic compensation and compensation to victims of crimes, which may require criminal prosecution.<br><br>
                If you are reluctant to report it yourself, you may be able to file the damage through a rape crisis center in each area. (Some universities also have a system to allow victims to report perpetrators without formal complaints (in this case, victims are usually guaranteed anonymity, while perpetrators are treated as real names and registered in the police's general information center. Therefore, when the perpetrator is later on the investigation network due to another incident, the police can easily check the previous report records, which in turn helps investigate the case and arrest the perpetrator.<br><br>
                <h4>5. Take time to recover</h4><br>
                Find a place where you can stay feeling safe for a few days. Don't go to work or school during that time and take a rest. It may be comforting to return to a 'normal' life as soon as possible, but you should know that you can be gripped by feelings of fear, anger, depression and guilt for weeks or more. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully follow the process of recovery while monitoring your own mood and condition.<br><br>
                <h4>6. Get a consultation</h4><br>
                It takes time to recover from the sexual violence experience, and it is much more helpful with proper psychological support at that time. So be introduced to a professional counselor through a rape crisis center, a college counseling center, or a doctor, and tell him what happened to you and how it affects your life. <br><br>
                Josette says the counseling she received after the damage helped her recover. "My guilty heart was filled with anger and anger. I found out it wasn't my fault, it was his fault. Of course, I know that I can't completely forget what I've experienced. It affected me so much that it changed me so much."<br><br>
                You can also participate in a group counseling program with other survivors. "It was a positive experience for me to participate in a support group for the victims after the incident. I'm doing really, really well right now," said Donna, a survivor of rape by an acquaintance. <br><br>
                <h4>7. Learn more about rape by acquaintances.</h4><br>
                After some time, when urgent situations are sorted out, find, read and learn more information and materials about rape by acquaintances. The deeper you know and understand the issue, the better you will be able to respond to your own experiences.<br><br>
                <h4>8. Build your own strength.</h4><br>
                Learn the defense strategies described in this book and, if possible, register for self-defense or self-assertion training programs operated by self-reflection and violence organizations or women's organizations to obtain specific methods.<br><br>
                <h4>9. Talk to other women.</h4><br>
                By talking to your friends one-on-one, or supporting your school or group's sexual violence education program, you can inform our society of the current state of sexual violence and how to respond to it. Furthermore, it may play a certain role in changing the perception of those who influence young people (mother teachers, coaches, social workers, group sponsors, religious leaders and community leaders). You are also a person who has experienced previous damage and recovery from it, and you can help them greatly by meeting and communicating with women who are suffering from the same problem.<br><br>
