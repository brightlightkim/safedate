            <h3>Careful in choosing a place</h3><br>
            <p>
                Where you are is usually as important as who you are with. Men who target acquaintances for rape always seek the right opportunity to realize it. Their attacks are likely to occur mainly in remote areas, such as in parked cars, DVD rooms, motel rooms, hotel rooms, evening beaches, and 'upstairs' rooms in social club halls. These spaces make it the most suitable place for perpetrators to take their victims, as they believe they can be undisturbed for hours. They also often drive their victims to the crime scene and threaten them that they cannot return home unless they first listen to what they want.<br><br>
                The perpetrator's favorite isolated location may be in remote rural areas, or in the center of a large city. Therefore, women need to insist only on going to public places (easy for others to see) such as restaurants and cinemas, especially if they have recently known each other.<br><br>
                Cheryl, for example, was raped by a man she met at a party arranged by a friend, and the victim was none other than in the man's car. She recalls the situation at the time like this. "He kept threatening to hit me, but I couldn't get out of the car. Because it was a bad neighborhood. I couldn't do anything because I was afraid that the eyes of the people in the neighborhood would be on us."<br><br>
                Meanwhile, another woman, Vivian, was damaged by a family friend in a forest cabin.</h4>
                <br>
                We arrived at a place where the driveway was chained off. We've been sitting in the car for quite a long time, pulling over in front of it. I refused to go inside, but not violently.<br><br>
                At the time, I thought my situation was different from any rape cases I'd ever heard of. And I thought about what a woman in a car with a man she knew and a woman she could choose to get out of there. Maybe I could go through the woods in skirts and shoes to the highway. But then what? If I stopped another stranger's truck and got on, would he have taken me to safety?<br><br>
