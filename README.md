This App intends to help all those who are abused mentally, verbally, and physically in the world.

The functions will be calling police when the app senses some warning voices. Then, it directly call the police or message them with the location they are at by using the GPS function.

It will also have some features for the victims to recognize what they experienced is abuse and there can be some messages to let them know what kind of legal actions they can take, and what kind of help they can receive. 

I will work this app with the advices from Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center.

This is my first project.
