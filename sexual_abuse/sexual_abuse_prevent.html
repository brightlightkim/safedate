    <h3>8 Tips for your Safe Date</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>You have right to determine and discuss sexual limits with your dating partner.<br/></li>
        <p>Before make sexual behavior, determine your limits, and discuss it clearly with your partner. Most of men do not have superpower that they don't know what you want. If you let them guess whatyou wnat, you can be the one who are hurted.<br/>
        Any sexual behavior including sex should be determined by each other's communications. It's not a wrong thing to just want a kiss.<br/>
        </p>
        <li>Be sure on your actions and decisions<br/></li>
        <p>If you learned that a woman should be shy, forget about it. Feminine doesn't mean passive. It's good to clearly say what you really want and feel. Clearly let them know that when you say &ldquo;No&rdquo; it's &ldquo;NO&rdquo;. <br/>
            If your partner ignores your limits, you should behave immediately. In this situation, you should let your partner knows what you are against. You can say it clearly and warmly. However, you can be angry if your partner continues to avoid your limits. Don't worry about keeping courtesy.
            If you need to shout to escape the situation or call others for help, DO it. Don't worry about becoming a &ldquo;good woman&rdquo;. Don't think about how your partner will feel but make some noise. <br/>
