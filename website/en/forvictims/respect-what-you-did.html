            <h3>Respect what you had to do to survive.</h3><br>
            <p>
                Many survivors of sexual violence blame themselves for the way they have dealt with it. You may not want to admit that you could only do so to survive. It may be hard to admit that you have to pay for something in order to greet each day. As a child at the time, you did the best you could under terrible circumstances and are still doing your best. The important thing is that you survived. It is therefore important to respect the resources you have.<br><br>
                <h4>Everybody's dealing with it.</h4><br>
                We all use strategies to cope with situations where we are unable to cope, struggling or stressed out. Most of the strategies mentioned in this chapter are those used once or several times by those who struggled against difficult situations in a broad sense. There are universal ones, and some belong to certain survivors and may or may not apply to you.<br><br>
                Some of your ways of coping would have been nurtured with positive power (e.g., becoming a competent society, being self-fulfilling, developing a sense of humor, or overcoming a crisis), and others would have self-defeating (e.g., larceny, drug or alcoholism). Some behaviors have both positive and destructive sides. Healing is possible when you distinguish between these two. By doing so, you can respect positive power while changing the unhelpful type.<br><br>
                <h4>Negative</h4><br>
                Denial is not what happens, pretending that what happened didn't happen and turning a blind eye. This is a common method found in families with alcoholics. It is also almost universal in places where kinship sexual violence occurs. "If you ignore it for long enough, it will disappear."<br><br>
                Denial can also be expressed in a silent way about sexual violence. It is actually much more comfortable for a child to deny reality rather than facing the fact that an adult around him couldn't protect himself and even hurt him.<br><br>
                One woman recalled the old days. The boy in the neighborhood said everyone in the neighborhood knew that her father had hit her the night before. I heard all the screams she made. However, the woman replied in a trivial way. "Really? But it wasn't me. My dad doesn't hit me.
                Some of the survivors of sexual violence admit that they were damaged, but deny that there were any traces of the damage. One woman says, "I told my therapist I had already overcome it, and he believed me."<br><br>
                <h4>reduce</h4><br>
                The downsizing method implies that what happened was not so bad. It's like this. The situation in which my father said, "Dad must be a little annoyed," even though he broke the armchair. Children raised in violent environments often firmly believe that everyone grows up in the same environment as them. Not all fathers pat their daughter's quilt that way. <br><br>
                Yes, I minimized the work. "Hey, so did your dad put the penis in your mouth? So what?" Five years ago, when people asked me if I was raised in a violent family, I said, "No." Because I'm not dead anyway. I broke my bone and was hospitalized, but I didn't die. You're soaked in blood, but at least you're not dead.<br><br>
                <h4>Rationalization</h4><br>
                It is a way for children to explain sexual violence. "He couldn't help it either. I'm drunk." They come up with reasons to forgive the perpetrator. "From the mother's point of view, it was too much to live with four children. It was no wonder you didn't take care of me." Rationalization protects the perpetrator and protects the survivor from emotional shock.<br><br>
                I always think, "Why the hell would he do that? I had a desire to find out what had to be done to this poor man because he had been horribly scratched? That's how I dramatized his story instead of mine. It was a way of forgiving Os rather than allowing him to feel anger and anger.<br><br>
                <h4>Forgot</h4><br>
                Forgetting is one of the most common and effective ways in which children deal with sexual violence. There is a powerful mechanism of oppression in the human mind. Many children can forget about the damage, even in the midst of abuse right now.<br><br>
                I drew a drawer on my mind. Everything that happens to me gets stuck in that drawer and then closes the door.<br><br>
                The ability to forget remains proven to be a situation where many survivors still do not recognize their damage as adults. Some survivors remember sexual violence but forget about their psychological state at the time. A woman who has been played on by her stepfather and brother throughout her childhood. "I've been so completely suppressed that I don't feel uncomfortable."<br><br>
                <h4>Packaging Face</h4><br>
                One way to deal with the reality and misery that you can't bear to see is to cover up your true feelings with a plausible face. There is a young girl who has a rich childhood on the outside, but if you look down, there is a young girl who suffers from nightmares and hides in the corner and looks at the scary people.<br><br>
                Many survivors continue this pattern as adults. Inside, he thinks he's evil and bad and knows something's wrong. But outside, it shows a completely different face.<br><br>
                It was when I was 21. I couldn't get up, so I was just lying on my bed and there were bugs crawling on the sheets. I thought I'd end up killing myself or going crazy. But do you know what I did right after 30 minutes? I changed my mood and wrote a very cheerful letter to my mother. It's coming out well. He desperately tried to keep this bright face.<br><br>
                But the thickness of that appearance is too meager. A 56-year-old therapist explained the division in his life.<br><br>
                As I grew up, I only did exemplary things. He was overly achievement-oriented. I was a model student throughout college, studied in London as a Fulbright scholarship student, and was expected to succeed in a great way.<br><br>
                I developed a hypocritical personality to meet other people's expectations. I'm hiding myself. Relationships with people were just exchanges of shells, nothing more. Thanks to money and status, I was able to get by.<br><br>
                I knew I was sick. I knew there was something secretly wrong in me. Underneath the hypocritical character, there was emptiness, and at the bottom of the void there was tremendous anger. If I didn't reveal any signs of problems in me, I gradually looked up, convinced that everything would be ruined and that my life would end up in a state of mental illness or a cage.<br><br>
                <h4>Funner</h4><br>
                A harsh sense of humor, so to speak, bitterness and cynicism, has allowed us to endure difficult times. As long as you make people laugh, a certain shield is installed. At least you don't have to cry while you're laughing.<br><br>
                For many years I have used humor to deflect the shame or pain I feel when I talk about incest rape. Of course, it was a variety of forms of black humor. <br><br>
                I once asked my therapist what he thought about my use of humor. I didn't think it was right to laugh over this. The therapist told me. "Humor is just one of many ways to deal with tragedy. Others hurt themselves or others, set fires or drink enough to kill themselves. You chose one of the many ways to deal with deep wounds, not only relatively harmless, but also smile and affirm your life. It wasn't a bad choice. It's not bad at all."<br><br>

                <h4>Dissociation</h4><br>
                A child who has become a victim of sexual violence is separated from his body so that he does not feel what is happening to him. Children are dissociated emotionally and psychologically from the experience if it is too severe to bear. You can't run away physically, so you're leaving your body. As a result, survivors often describe themselves as seeing violence take place over a long distance.<br><br>
                I felt like I was getting out of my body. I could feel myself sitting on a chair, but I felt like I was floating around after getting out of my body. It was exactly, like, spreading into the air. I know that the body is in the chair, but the rest of the body is outside the body I know.<br><br>
                This process is harry. Harry is an excellent coping strategy for children and allows them to live through the disastrous situation, but it can lead to other problems for adult survivors. As Harry often becomes a habit, there are many survivors who continue to experience Harry, even if it is a minor level, whenever they are threatened or feared.<br><br>
                For a long time, I'm out of my body. It's like, it feels empty from the bottom of my neck. There's a ladder. He goes on the ladder to see what's going on. A little kid, that's me, sitting in his head, looking out through his eyes.<br><br>
                Some people go somewhere they don't know when they're dissociated. "I don't know what happened when I was out of my body. Because I wasn't there."<br><br>
                <h4>Distance Spacing out</h4><br>
                Survivors have a tremendous ability to escape from their present space and not exist there. There are a number of ways here.<br><br>
                I used to walk into walls, into doors, into furniture. Because I wasn't in my body. Some bruises were cheap expenses to pay to forget.<br><br>
                One survivor still stares at an object in the room whenever he feels scared. The way he did it while he was being sexually assaulted.<br><br>
                I remember every minute of all the rooms I've been through. I can't remember who I talked to and what I said, but I can tell you exactly what the window looks like.<br><br>
                There are also survivors who pretend to be there even though they are not there.<br><br>
                I've spent my life separating myself from people or going somewhere else without being there. I'm confident that I'm very proficient. I'm sitting there, but inside I go somewhere else and come back. So I don't know anything about the conversation. I could keep talking. But what's really weird is that most people don't notice that I wasn't there!<br><br>
                This kind of distancing disconnects itself from pain, but also has problems that cause people to miss various lives and relationships.<br><br>
