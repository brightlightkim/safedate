            <h3>Self Defense Strategies</h3><br>
            <p>
                The self-defense mechanisms listed here are listed in this way for survivors to survive rather than desirable ones.
                <h4>Avoiding people</h4><br>
                Sometimes survivors isolate themselves. He thinks he is not lovely because he is not worthy of kindness, love, attention, and hurtful.<br><br>
                Or maybe it's because I've never learned how to reach out and start a conversation or how to relate to someone else. But meeting humans is a basic need. This lack of relationship leads to loneliness, alienation and despair.<br><br>
                I knew I was different. Something's wrong. The other kids noticed that, too. He smelled it from me. When the children notice the weak... You know what happens. I did everything I could to stand out. He was acting weird. I didn't get annoyed, so he just left me alone. My only friends were people I met online pretending to be someone else. To be honest, I'd say I didn't have a true friend.<br><br>
                <h4>Avoid intimate relationships</h4><br>
                If you don't allow anyone to come near you, no one will hurt you. "If we don't have human relationships, we may not enter violent relationships," explains one woman. Another woman said, "I have maintained a safe state of being alone."<br><br>
                Some survivors limit determined and intimate relationships. A woman said. "Even if you're a friend, you can end your friendship at the drop of a hat and never look back again." Another woman only dated men who lived far away. "One of them had to fly and the other didn't have a car. It was a pretty good operation."<br><br>
                Some survivors are less blatantly avoiding intimate relationships. On the outside, he is open and friendly, but he hides his inner feelings. One survivor said he talks casually because there are ten official secrets.<br><br>
                I tell people things about myself that are too private to talk about. But I don't trust them and I don't get close to them. They don't know what I feel. I hardly ever tell you that. <br><br>
                <h4>Avoid sexual activity</h4><br>
                I got married intentionally to a man who was not sexual at all. He was a man who had sex about three times a year and was perfect in that respect. I started using the basic body warm-up method when I wanted to get pregnant. Being pregnant with a child is more like artificial insemination.<br><br>
                Some people become numb and no longer react.<br><br>
                One of the ways I was able to cope with the fact that I felt a sense of pleasure in the midst of paternal sexual violence was to cast this spell. 'It will never give you pleasure. Sex has given me pleasure when I shouldn't have felt it, so it should never happen in the future.' So I don't feel it anymore. I don't pay attention to sex. I hardly think about sex and sex doesn't give me any pleasure. Others may feel pleasure when having sex, but I'm dying to get out of it. So you don't have to have sex again.<br><br>
                <h4>Keep Control</h4><br>
                Control is also a subject that penetrates the lives of many survivors.<br><br>
                I'm obsessed with doing things my way. If I don't do that, I think I'm going to die. But there are a lot of microscopic things interacting in everyday life, so I can't control them all, can I?<br><br>
                Survivors struggle to keep their lives in order.<br><br>
                Shoes should always be in the same place. The room should always be clean. When I go to work in the morning, I repeat the routine of arranging pens and keys in a certain place. If I could control it, I would. When I was young, there were so many things I couldn't control.<br><br>
                There are many survivors who extend their desire to control not only objects but also people. Negotiations or compromises are a challenge for them. The strong desire to control makes it difficult to judge a situation from another person's perspective. Also accepting what others like is considered a tremendous threat.<br><br>
                <h4>Overbound</h4><br>
                If he had paid attention to the details of his surroundings when he was young, he might not have been harmed. So now you may think you should be aware of where you are in the room. You sit across the door and confirm that no one is creeping up from behind. You would also be overly conscious of their privacy, always predicting people's moods and desires. As a result, there were women who said that they were a surefire support for spreading rumors about others. If she knew what people around her were doing, she thought no one would ever surprise her again.<br><br>
                <h4>Pretending to be confused</h4><br>
                Paradoxically, survivors sometimes exercise control by causing confusion. If you lose control of an action, you put the blame on people around you for other problems you've encountered recently. In this way, you (although negative) get noticed and eventually become a control freak. Laura's father always said this to her. "Family is a dictatorship in which someone who is the weakest sits as a monarch."<br><br>
                The same goes for children with alcohol-addicted parents, who are skilled at solving crises, but are also good at creating crises. Survivor Eriline Munyeon says.<br><br>
                It is said that humans tend to be attracted to the side they are familiar with, the side they know. If this is true, it can also explain why survivors are in the midst of chaos. Not only are they accustomed to confusion, but they also treat it brilliantly. I can handle even the most extraordinary situations, and in fact, I am able to excel in those situations. However, in everyday life, people get confused. Under normal conditions, it is always hysterical. Before I realized I was a survivor, I couldn't figure out why my life was so scarred. Not only have I never been in a normal situation, but the thought of it was terrible. Whenever my life was at peace, I always wanted something great to happen, so I wanted to be comfortable in it. People may sometimes crave to be in extreme situations, but I have never been able to escape them.<br><br>
                <h4>Safety first</h4><br>
                By making stable and predictable choices, you can try to gain control or at least control. There is little danger. But there is also a price to be protected. The opportunity for challenge is lost.<br><br>
                I married a stable person, a person who won't leave me, and above all, a person who won't be forced. He was like a rock. I chose a reliable person because I thought the ground I was stepping on was shaking. We had a traditional wedding. There was really nothing I had to do. It's Booning, who would only cling to her husband. He was a successful man and a high rank, so he was under his shadow for many years. He lived 22 years under his protection. That's how I've lived my life.<br><br>
                <h4>Find refuge in religion</h4><br>
                Survivors pursue safety and control while clinging to faith with divergent rules and boundaries.<br><br>
                <h4>Desperate escape</h4><br>
                You may have attempted to run away from home when you were a child or in puberty. Or I fall into sleep, books, or television. Many adult survivors still remain pathological readers. It's a woman's horse. "I buy a lot of novels and keep reading them until I feel sleepy. It usually lasts 36 hours at a time." And some people sit in front of the television for hours. <br><br>
                People who find it hard to believe that sexual violence really happened believe that something else is happening. Sometimes children create fantasies about seeking power in lethargic situations. One woman dreamed of living alone in a small house with locks on every door. Another spent his childhood dreaming of revenge. <br><br>
                Fantasy can be a source of creative life. A teenage woman who needed to escape very desperately believed that Star Trek was real. At the end of the series, she heard the voices of the main characters in her head and finally began writing the script herself. Now she is a successful science novelist.<br><br>
                <h4>Addiction, OCD, Self-destructive Behavior</h4>
                Addiction is a common way to block memories and silence groans from the pain of sexual violence. If you had someone to rely on, you would have found another way to deal with sadness, shame and anger. However, if such support and protection had not been met, he would have had to find a way to deal with the situation by himself. So you may have tried to numb your feelings by hanging on drugs, alcohol, and food. He may be addicted to dangerous situations, crises, or sexual activity. <br><br>
                <h4>sexual addiction</h4><br>
                Some survivors have dealt with sexual activity by avoiding it, while others have tried to satisfy all other needs, including those that are not sexual at all. As one survivor confessed, "The fact that you don't want to have sex with me means that you don't love me. I wanted to feel loved, so I did it with anyone who wanted to have sex with me."<br><br>
                Like this woman, you get to have sex with someone you don't know or do something that puts an important relationship at risk. They become addicted to pornography, pornographic phone calls, Internet sex, and engage in sexual activity in shameful, violent, dangerous, or reminiscent of perpetrators. You may continue to be exposed to sexual violence or you may commit another person. Whether you do this like a habit or try to break it off many times and try with good intentions, it will be difficult to break it off.<br><br>
                <h4>Anorexia and bulimia</h4><br>
                Young girls affected by sexual violence may develop anorexia or bulimia. Everything seems normal on the outside due to the cover-up of sexual violence, but the family system is extremely controlled, so if someone in the family shows anorexia and bulimia, it can be a cry for help. Mature as a woman is a terrible thing for a girl who is forced into unwanted sex. Anorexia or bulimia can be an attempt to say no and to control one's changing body.<br><br>
                <h4>Intense eating</h4><br>
                For many people, obsessive eating is a way to express emotions and avoid pain. In addition, some survivors believe that when they get fat, sexual access will be lost. <br><br>
                <h4>Too busy</h4><br>
                One of the most commonly accepted behaviors of obsessive compulsive disorder is business. Our culture rewards achievement and considers the busy pace of life normal. However, many survivors avoid facing themselves, their feelings and their past, making their lives overly busy. A survivor who has lived up to his list every morning said this. "I often mourn the ease of life I've never had in my life."<br><br>
                <h4>Workaholic</h4><br>
                Survivors often develop a desire to achieve too much in order to compensate for criticism of themselves hidden deep inside. To excel at work means to gain something they can control. It is also an act of considerable support in our culture that gives high value to achievement. You can see the intense motivation for success in working too hard, but it is also a way of avoiding having to relate to people around you or your inner world.<br><br>
                <h4>Theft</h4><br>
                Stealing is an act of concentration. In a short moment you can forget everything, including the fact that you were assaulted. It is also a channel to refresh or excite, or to recreate the guilt and fear you had when you were first sexually assaulted. Stealing is a way of denying authority, an attempt to get back what has been deprived, and an attempt to equalize scores. Of course, it is also a cry for help. <br><br>
                <h4>Hurt yourself</h4><br>
                Self-harm is a way of controlling the experience of suffering. Instead of the perpetrator hurting you, you hurt yourself. Self-harm is a way of coping that many people use for complex reasons. He is trying to express anger, show how hard he is in a situation outside, or feel something in an insensitive state, or say he needs help. <br><br>
