            <h3>First of all</h3><br>
            <p>
                You can heal the aftereffects of sexual violence.<br><br>
                If you're embarrassed by these pages, remind yourself that you've already been through the hardest part of sexual violence or something like that. You've survived an overwhelming ordeal simply beyond control. The sexual violence that gnawed at you has simultaneously provided the inner resources necessary for healing. There is one thing anyone who survives sexual violence can confidently declare. It is the fact that he has power. Also, because they understand what is needed for healing, the power can lead directly to the destination of healing. One woman said: "No one will touch me anymore."<br><br>
                <h4>Writing training: aftereffects</h4>
                Describe how sexual violence is affecting you now. What feelings do you continue to have about self-respect, your work, your relationship with others, and your sexuality? How is your life suffering and what limitations are you facing?<br><br>
                Describe the power developed by sexual violence. Think of the things that were very important for you to survive. What are the characteristics that made you survive? Patience? Flexibility? Self-fulfillment? Describe your power with a confident mind.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h4> and (potential) perpetrators </h4>
            <p>
                You can't, you can't hurt others with trauma for a really long time.</h4><br>
                I don't know you. However, if there is temptation such as sexual violence or sexual harassment, I would like to beg you to boldly leave the position. She's a very precious child to someone next to you, an older sister, a younger brother, and a mother. Please, I beg you, don't even think about it and don't give me room for this.<br><br>
                You can't create this situation by not taking her out of the way. Please protect her if you love her. If you really put your bad imagination in your head into action, you'll definitely take that responsibility. As a more painful referee in the next life if not in this world. So please don't do it.<br><br>
            </p>
