            <h3>8 Guidelines for Safe Dating</h3><br>
            <p>
                It is the perpetrator, not the woman, who causes the rape by an acquaintance. However, there are certain things that women can do on their own to reduce the risk of damage. In this regard, we introduce the "guidelines for beliefs and behaviors that women should adopt" presented by sexual violence counselors and expert groups.<br><br>
                <h4>1. You have the right to set your own sexual limits and communicate with your opponent.</h4>
                <br>
                Set your limits and clarify them to the other person before performing sexual behavior. Most men don't know what you want because they're not psychic. If you let the other person guess what you want, you can eventually get hurt.<br><br>
                Whatever sexual behavior, including sex, should be determined by communication between the two. Just because you say you're not interested in sex doesn't mean it's rude, and expressing your interest in sex doesn't mean that you're not a woman. It's not wrong at all whether you just want a kiss, or just allow a kiss and a pat on the chest, or anything else without an insert.<br><br>
                <h4>2. Be confident in your decisions and choices.</h4><br>
                Forget it if you've learned to be shy. Being feminine doesn't mean being passive. Rather, the clearer you say what you want and what you really feel, the better. When you say 'No', make it clear that it means 'No', and when you say 'Yes', you should be able to figure out for yourself what you agree with first.<br><br>
                If you put a limit on sexual behavior and your opponent ignores it, act immediately. In this situation, you should clearly tell the opponent what you are against. You can speak friendly yet firmly. If you do so and your opponent continues to ignore your principles, get angry. Don't worry about being polite. If you have to shout or hurt someone else to get help or run away, feel free to do so. Forget about being a 'fine woman'. Don't worry about how the other person will feel and make a fuss. <br><br>
                Seri gave the above advice before her stepdaughter went to college. This comes from Seri's experience of going to meet her college friend when she was 18 years old. It also comes from the experience of going to meet Seri's college friend. Mira's college friend introduced Mira to a college beach party with bonfires and beer. Because the date was kind and good-looking, Seri's head was just beginning to imagine him falling in love with himself. But after one kiss, when she walked to the beach at the man's suggestion, her sweet fantasies were shattered. <br><br>
                He went to the beach and asked to see the sky. But as soon as he got out of sight, he threw me on the floor and said, If you refuse me, I'll beg you inside me, and I'll be pregnant. I was quite strong, so I tried to escape somehow. I even found a piece of wood to hit him. But I was still thinking to myself, 'What would everyone think if I screamed or hurt that person? If I made a fuss, it would ruin other people's time.' In a word, I didn't want to make a problem. I grew up being educated to be considerate of others. <br><br>
                I wish I were the same as I am now. Then it wouldn't have happened.<br><br>
                <h4>3. Stay awake.</h4><br>
                The best way to control the situation is to keep track of what's going on with me. Many cases of rape by acquaintances occur in women who are drunk or in a daze. In particular, men who plan to rape acquaintances (although they claim that the woman was "tempted"), use alcohol and drugs on purpose to obscure the other woman's perception and reduce resistance. Therefore, if you like alcohol, you should learn to control it moderately. By getting drunk on your own, don't help perpetrators looking for such women.<br><br>
                Drugs are different from alcohol. It's illegal and once taken, it's often hard to moderate it because it goes to the end. In addition, there are many different types of drugs and their effects vary from individual to individual, making it impossible to "prepare" in advance. For example, just because you've taken one drug, you can't think of another as okay.<br><br>
                <h4>4. Find out about your new date.</h4><br>
                Don't leave a party place (MT place or anywhere) with someone you just met, someone you don't know well. Also, if you start dating, you'd better learn more about the person by meeting with friends the first few times or by getting information from the woman you met before. Talking about the exact date plan before dating is also a safe way.<br><br>
                <h4>5. Keep in control. </h4><br>
                Pay for yourself so that dating doesn't look like a deal and it doesn't translate into something "debt" to you. (Or if the other person buys a movie ticket, split it up the way you buy pizza later.)<br><br>
                Take your car out on your first date, and consider where you choose to meet. In case of emergency, be prepared to call a friend or relative to pick you up late at night. Always carry plenty of cash with you so you can take a taxi home alone. And when the man you just met offers you a ride, don't accept it.<br><br>
                <h4>6. Take care of yourself.</h4><br>
                Don't think other people will care about you or protect you from danger. Instead, hold a self-defense program in advance in case you need it. In most areas, these programs (programs develop the ability to recognize dangerous situations, act decisively, avoid attacks and respond strongly).<br><br>
                <h4>7. Trust your gut</h4><br>
                During her first date with her new boyfriend, Merrill noticed that he had a side he didn't like (a "macho" tendency and regarded women as his property), but lightly ignored her. When they returned to Merrill's house together after a date, the man threatened to hurt her and then raped her. This is what Merrill says. "After that terrible night, what I learned was that I should trust my inner self. I also learned that you have to be really careful about who you're going out with. If you have any doubts, don't hesitate to turn around and run out as fast as you can."<br><br>
                When you feel 'bad' about a man or a situation, don't think there's something wrong with you. Rather take it as a sign from within and believe it. And stay away from the object of inherent danger. When you get a signal from within, you have to get out of the situation quickly, instead of being considerate or interpreting it in his favor.<br><br>
                <h4>8. Students need special safety measures.</h4><br>
                For new college girls, it is considered a dangerous time until they enter the dormitory and have their first vacation. This is because there are many female students who are repeatedly raped by men they met at college during that period. New girls are likely to be targeted by someone because they don't know much about normal college life or campus geography. They may also be eager to test the limits of a parentless world by doing what society has allowed them to do, such as drinking heavily or attending parties enthusiastically.<br><br>
                Even at a time when male and female clubs rush to find new members, new female students are likely to be exposed to danger. Not only are parties held every weekend night, but that kind of parties attract a large number of college seniors who enjoy targeting innocent new girls or "scoring" them. <br><br>
